# Algorithmic Crypto Project

## Overview
The Algorithmic Crypto Project is a research and development initiative focused on using algorithmic trading strategies to analyze and trade cryptocurrencies. The project leverages quantitative methods, data analytics, and machine learning to develop automated trading strategies tailored for digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Features
- **Market Data Analysis**: Processes historical and real-time market data to extract insights.
- **Algorithmic Trading Strategies**: Implements multiple trading algorithms, including trend following, mean reversion, and arbitrage.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses AI and statistical models to predict price movements and optimize trading performance.

# Backlog
- **Backtesting Framework**: Evaluates strategies using historical data before deployment.
- **Risk Management**: Implements stop-loss, take-profit, and portfolio diversification techniques.
- **Live Trading**: Supports integration with cryptocurrency exchanges for real-time execution.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for research, analysis, and prototyping.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Talib**: TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform technical analysis of financial market data.
- **CCXT**: Integration with cryptocurrency exchanges.
